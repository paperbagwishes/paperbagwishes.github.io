    Hello, my name is Melanie Murphy and I am a fourth year student at Eastern Washington University. Originally, I grew up in the city of Bremerton, WA and then later relocated to Cheney, WA in hopes to pursue a design degree. As a child, my mother enrolled me in many out-of-school art classes which initially sparked my curiosity for design. In high school, I experimented with different mediums such as film editing and photography. These experiences, along with many more, led me to make the decision to pursue a design degree. I am in my second year in the program and absolutely love learning the material. I have taken what I have learned from my courses and applied it by designing multiple sweatshirts and tee's for my sorority, posters for recruitment events, and a promotional video for a dance competition. I only hope to continue learning and to improve my skills as a designer. </p>
